# This is the second assignment.
# In the class UtilGobang, we have already helped to implement other functions that may be
# used later, and if necessary, you can directly use some or all of these functions.
# Gobang inherits the UtilGobang Class, and all you need to do is to complete the remaining
# key functions. Please refer to the comments before each question for a better understanding.
# Here are some useful methods from external libraries (which have already been imported in UtilGobang)
# for your reference.
# y = copy.deepcopy(x) | Copies the value of object x and assigns it to y.
# x = random.choice(l) | Samples an element x from a list l with equal probability.
# np.count_nonzero(s) | Returns the number of zeros in the array s.

# Some important explanations regarding the variables:
# self.board:   An N x N two-dimensional np.array stored inside the Gobang class (also in UtilGobang).
#               The value of self.board[i][j] should be:
#               0, if the current position [i][j] has not been occupied by any piece.
#               1, if a black chess piece is located.
#               2, if a white chess piece is located.
#
# self.Q:       A dictionary {state: {action: q}} that stores the estimated Q* values.
#               For a given state-action pair (s, a), you can access q(s, a) by reading self.Q[s][a].
#               It is essential to ensure that the state has already been hashed.
#
# color:        1 represents black, 2 represents white.
#
# action:       A triplet (1, x, y) for black pieces.
#               For example, action = (1, 0, 0) indicates that the next step is to set self.board[0][0] = 1.
#
# self.action_space:
#               A list [(int, int)] that stores the available positions on the current chessboard where
#               players can place their pieces.
#
# noise:        A triplet (2, x, y) used to indicate that the opponent (white) will place a piece
#               at (x, y), resulting in self.board[x][y] = 2.
#
# Additionally, the usage of several key functions:
#
# max_black, max_white = self.count_max_connections(state):
#               This function is used to determine the maximum number of consecutive black and
#               white chess pieces in a specific state, returning max_black and max_white.
#
# state = self.array_to_hashable(state_):
#               Converts the np.array type state into a hashable value, enabling it to be
#               stored as a key in a dictionary.

    def sample_action_and_noise(self, eps: float) -> Tuple[Tuple[int, int, int], Tuple[int, int, int]]:
        """
        The function returns the action and noise based on the current state represented by self.board.

        During the learning process, the action is chosen following the epsilon-greedy algorithm, which entails the
        following:

        The action is randomly selected with a probability of epsilon (eps), and with a probability of 1-eps, the
        action corresponding to the current maximum estimated q-values q[s][a] is chosen. If the state-action pair
        (s, a) has not been recorded in self.Q, a random action should also be returned. The action must be selected
        from self.action_space to prevent overlapping chess pieces.

        *** IMPORTANT: Remember to remove the selected position (x, y) from self.action_space once the action (1, x, y)
            is chosen. ***

        It is worth noting that the action space in our scenario may change over time. This dynamic action space
        approach is based on the assumption that the optimal policy learned in a dynamic action space with limited
        rewards and constraints on piece placement should be equivalent to the one learned in a fixed action space with
        penalties (e.g., negative infinity rewards) for overlapping pieces. You are encouraged to contemplate whether
        this equivalence truly holds.

        Additionally, we implement dynamic epsilons to enhance the learning outcome, which are pre-computed before
        being passed to the function sample_action_and_noise.
